However, in recent years(2020-2024), the nearterm data shows the precipitation in summer and winter do not make any notable difference in Southeastern Utah Group National Parks.\nAlso, we can also know that the contiguous annual precipitation is lower in recent years (2020-2024) than historic period, which aligns with the report about ‘contiguous U.S. average annual precipitation in 2023 was 29.46 inches, 0.48 inch below average, ranking in the driest third of the 129-year record, when 2022 is even dryer than 2023’."
